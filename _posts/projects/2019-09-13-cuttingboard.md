<p>In an attempt to learn the CNC router tool, I decided to make my friend Morgan a Georgia Tech cutting board as a graduation present. The main wood is yellow pine and the inset GT logo is walnut. To get the walnut into a proper size, I had to do resaw the wood into 3 thinner pieces and glue them together to form a square. The pine was prepared by first cutting it to size, rounding the edges with a router, and planing both sides. I then used the CNC router to cut the positive of the GT logo in the walnut and the negative in the pine. The logo was then glued in and the top face was re-planed. To finish and seal the board, butcher block conditioner was used.</p>
