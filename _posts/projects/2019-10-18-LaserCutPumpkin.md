<p>To begin this project, I sawed the pumpkin in half and gutted it. This is because the original pumpkin was too tall to fit into the laser cutter. After putting the pumpkin in and doing 5 laser passes at full power and low speed and the laser still not going through, I decided to help the laser out. The laser did cut the pumpkin, but it did not cut all the way through. I used a box cutter to follow the path of the laser and cut the design all the way through the pumpkin. To reattach the two halves, I grinded off the heads of a couple of nails and put them into the pumpkin to act as skewers. The nail skewer method was vaguely successful; however, to add to ascetics and help support the two halves, the pumpkin was also stapled together as well.</p>
