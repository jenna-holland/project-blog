<p>After finding a strand of lights for really cheap at Walmart, I decided that I needed to build something for the apartment to put them on. The only rule was that it had to cost $0. So, I went to the makerspace and sifted through the scrap wood and screws pile until I had all the right pieces to build a tree. I made the stem removable from the base so it can be broken down and moved easily. The final decorations are courtesy of my friends. </p>
