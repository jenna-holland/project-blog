<p>To begin this project, I drew a simple turtle on a piece of paper. I then slowly used flush cutters, glass snips, and a diamond sander to shape the individual pieces to fit in the outline. After all the pieces were shaped to size, copper tape was applied to all the edges. This is so that the solder has something to adhere to on the glass. When all the taping was done, I soldered the pieces together and attached a wire loop for hanging. </p>
