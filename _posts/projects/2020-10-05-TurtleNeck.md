<p>In an attempt to learn how to sew and embroider, I came up with the idea for a turtleneck shirt with turtles embroidered around the neck. I got the perfect turtleneck from goodwill and used a Brother SE1900 to do the embroidering. Calibrating the new machine took about 2 days of work messing with stabilizer thicknesses, thread tensions, and bobbin tensions. I embroidered probably around 25 test turtles. Once I was satisfied with the output, I embroidered 3 turtles swimming around the neck of the shirt inside out (so the turtles are facing the correct way when the neck is folded down).
