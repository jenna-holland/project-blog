<p>This project was an attempt to kill 2 birds with one stone. I needed stickers for my new laptop and the vinyl cutter needed to be set up. The setup was fairly simple because there are only 2 main variables to control: pressure and speed. I perfected the settings for vinyl and then drew up a quick design. My design had multiple colors so each color layer had to be separated out and cut individually. Each individual layer is then realigned on clear transfer paper and then applied to the laptop.</p>
